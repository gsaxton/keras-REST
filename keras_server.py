    #"Subtracting the dataset mean serves to "center" the data. Additionally, you ideally would like to divide by
    #the sttdev of that feature or pixel as well if you want to normalize each feature value to a z-score.The reason
    #we do both of those things is because in the process of training our network, we're going to be multiplying
    #(weights) and adding to (biases) these initial inputs in order to cause activations that we then backpropogate
    #with the gradients to train the model.  We'd like in this process for each feature to have a similar range so
    #hat our gradients don't go out of control (and that we only need one global learning rate multiplier)".
